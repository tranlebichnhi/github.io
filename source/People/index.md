The Brianza region, just outside Milan, in 1962 was the most renowned region for furniture making and the artists produced original collections that were extremely well received by the rich and famous crowd of Milan and Europe.

Their dedication, passion and conviction have hence passed through generations prosperously; the tradition of manufacturing exquisite furniture lives on today with Casadora Furniture Corporation.
